# Personal Website – Tom McCarthy

This is a simple, minimal personal website with elements inspired by https://sive.rs/.

The goal is to create a clear, easy-to-use space that shares who I am, what I’m working on, and what I’m thinking about — without unnecessary clutter.

## Purpose

This site is designed to:

- Be simple and fast  
- Be easy to navigate  
- Focus on content over design  
- Stay lightweight and easy to update  
- Highlight what I’m doing now  

It’s meant to feel personal, honest and useful.

## Pages

- Home  
- About  
- Portfolio   
- Contact  

---

## Design Approach

- Minimal layout  
- Mostly HTML and CSS  
- Little to no JavaScript  
- Mobile-friendly  
- No heavy frameworks  

If something doesn’t improve clarity, it doesn’t belong.

## Current Development

This initial version of the site was a simple placeholder that I put online about three months ago.

It was meant to establish a basic presence while planning a more refined design.

I am now working on the next iteration of the site.

The upcoming version will:

- Use a darker theme  
- Include Linux console–style elements  
- Show where the user is on the site using terminal-inspired design  

Next update: **25/02/2026**
