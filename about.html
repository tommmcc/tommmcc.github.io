        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
I’m originally from regional Victoria and moved to Melbourne four years ago to pursue my studies. 
I chose Information Technology as a broad and future-focused foundation.
</p>

<p>
RMIT’s IT pathway program exposed me to the full spectrum of technology disciplines. 
I gained hands-on experience in networking with Cisco hardware and Packet Tracer, built and managed virtualised environments across Windows Server, macOS and Linux, and designed functional web applications from wireframe to deployment.
</p>

<p>
My coursework has included AWS cloud infrastructure, software engineering in Java and Python, full-stack web development, cybersecurity fundamentals, blockchain technologies, and project management in collaborative environments.
</p>

<p>
The areas that have resonated most with me are cloud infrastructure, software engineering & blockchain — disciplines where systems thinking and practical execution meet real-world impact.

          <h3>Currently: 17/02/26</h3> 
          <p>
            I’m in my final semester of my Bachelor’s in IT.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recently I’ve been focusing on cloud infrastructure and its financial impact.
            I’ve completed the <strong>FinOps Certified Practitioner</strong> and
            the <strong>AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner</strong> certifications. 
            Next up I'm planning on completing the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate course, I think it will help to flesh out my Cloud credentials.
