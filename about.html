    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Soon graduating with a Bachelor of IT from RMIT, Melbourne-based and ready to get into the industry. Beyond the degree, I’m drawn to blockchain, tokenization, IoT and the future of work—exploring how emerging techs impact on society. Open to all opportunities and eager to contribute ideas and energy to teams in Melbourne or beyond..</p>
    <p>Outside of tech, I enjoy going back to my hometown in regional Victoria and seeing friends.</p>
